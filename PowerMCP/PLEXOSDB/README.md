# PLEXOSDB — PowerMCP connector

A thin re-export of [`plexosdb-mcp`](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/plexosdb/tree/main/src/plexosdb-mcp)'s
own MCP server (direct PLEXOS object/property/membership CRUD — 29 tools) plus two
tools PowerMCP adds, `translate_to_sienna` and `compare_solutions`, that call
[`r2x`](https://pypi.org/project/r2x/) directly.

No PLEXOS license, PLEXOS install, or vendor network call is required anywhere in
this connector: `plexosdb` reads and writes the PLEXOS XML database format directly
via a pure-Python/SQLite implementation. This is the PLEXOS-side half of a two-format
proposal — the paired `SIENNA` connector (solve + `translate_to_plexos`) is tracked
separately as [PowerMCP #54](https://github.com/Power-Agent/PowerMCP/issues/54); the
two share no PowerMCP code, only the upstream `r2x` dependency each calls directly.

## Install

Two packages are needed. Only one of them is on PyPI.

**1. PowerMCP with the `plexosdb` extra** (covers `r2x-plexos`/`r2x-plexos-to-sienna`/
`r2x-sienna` — the translation libraries). Pinned to `r2x-plexos>=0.3.0` specifically,
*not* the `r2x` meta-package (which still transitively pins the buggy `r2x-plexos==0.2.0`
— see [Known upstream issues](#known-upstream-issues-tracked-and-worked-around) below).
Installing that version currently requires allowing prereleases, for reasons also
explained there:

```bash
pip install --prerelease=allow "powermcp[plexosdb]"   # uv
# or: pip install --pre "powermcp[plexosdb]"           # pip
```

**2. `plexosdb-mcp` itself, manually, from source.** It is a real, cleanly packaged
project (its own `pyproject.toml`, versioned, with a `plexosdb-mcp` console script),
just not yet released to PyPI. Its own metadata pins a direct git dependency on
`plexosdb`, and PyPI rejects packages that declare that — which is also why
PowerMCP's own `plexosdb` extra above does not (and cannot) pull it in automatically
without breaking `pip install powermcp` for everyone else:

```bash
pip install "plexosdb-mcp @ git+https://github.com/NatLabRockies/plexosdb.git@main#subdirectory=src/plexosdb-mcp"
```

Then run it through PowerMCP as usual:

```bash
powermcp run plexosdb
```

Verify both real installs and the resulting registered tools with `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install --prerelease=allow plexosdb "r2x-plexos>=0.3.0" "r2x-plexos-to-sienna>=0.1.0" "r2x-sienna>=0.4.0"
uv pip install "plexosdb-mcp @ git+https://github.com/NatLabRockies/plexosdb.git@main#subdirectory=src/plexosdb-mcp"
python -c "from plexosdb_mcp.server import build_mcp_server; print(build_mcp_server())"
```

### Why `powermcp run plexosdb` launches this as a script, not a module

`PLEXOSDB/plexosdb_mcp/main.py` deliberately lives in a package also named
`plexosdb_mcp` — the same import name as the upstream distribution it re-exports
(this package re-exports that distribution's server object under the same name). Because of
that shared name, the registry launches it as a **script** (`entry_rel=
"plexosdb_mcp/main.py"`), not as a module. Module-style launch would add `PLEXOSDB/`
itself to `sys.path`, and `import plexosdb_mcp` inside `main.py` would then resolve to
*this* package before ever reaching the real, installed one — confirmed by direct
testing while building this connector. Script launch only puts this file's own
directory on `sys.path`, so the bare `import plexosdb_mcp` correctly falls through to
site-packages. For the same reason, do not `pip install -e PLEXOSDB` into the same
environment you're also installing the upstream `plexosdb-mcp` package into and expect
both to cleanly coexist as independent site-packages entries.

## Usage: inspecting a PLEXOS study

Every re-exported plexosdb-mcp tool operates on an in-memory session, keyed by a
`session_id` returned from `open_xml_session`:

```python
from plexosdb_mcp.server import build_mcp_server, MCPServerState

state = MCPServerState()
server = build_mcp_server(state)  # or import plexosdb_mcp.main's `mcp` directly

session = state.open_xml_session("/path/to/Study.xml")
session_id = session["session_id"]

# then, via MCP or by calling the registered tool functions directly:
#   list_classes(session_id)
#   list_objects_by_class(session_id, "Generator")
#   get_object_properties(session_id, "Generator", "Coal_Gen")
#   list_object_memberships(session_id, "Generator", "Coal_Gen")
#   ... 25 more (session/discovery/edit/export) — see `capabilities` below.
```

Run `plexosdb-mcp capabilities` (installed by the git command above) for the full,
categorized tool list, or `plexosdb-mcp doctor` to check `fastmcp`/`plexosdb` are
importable and that an empty in-memory session opens cleanly.

## Usage: `translate_to_sienna`

```python
from plexosdb_mcp.main import translate_to_sienna

result = translate_to_sienna(
    xml_path="/path/to/Study.xml",
    model_name="Base",           # a PLEXOS Model object name — see list_models
    output_path="/tmp/out/system.json",
)
# {"ok": True, "output_path": ..., "model_name": "Base",
#  "component_types": {"ACBus": 12, "ThermalStandard": 4, ...}}
```

This calls r2x's real, public API directly — no PowerMCP-authored bridge module:

1. `r2x_plexos.PLEXOSParser` parses the PLEXOS XML into an `r2x_core.System`.
2. `r2x_plexos_to_sienna.plexos_to_sienna` translates that System to a Sienna-shaped
   System.
3. `r2x_sienna.SiennaExporter` writes it to `output_path` as **Sienna PSY JSON** —
   the format PowerSystems.jl consumes, and what the sibling `SIENNA` connector
   (PowerMCP #54) loads and solves.

`compare_solutions(xml_path_a, model_name_a, xml_path_b, model_name_b)` parses two
PLEXOS models the same way and diffs their component-type counts — useful for
comparing two scenarios of a study, or a study before/after an edit made through
plexosdb-mcp's own CRUD tools. It does not solve anything (no PLEXOS license is
present); solving is the paired `SIENNA` connector's job.

## Known upstream issues (tracked, and worked around)

`translate_to_sienna`/`compare_solutions` were exercised end-to-end against a real
PLEXOS XML study (`plexosdb`'s own test fixture, `tests/data/run_of_river_case/
TestSystem.xml` — a full, non-trivial study: 103 PLEXOS classes, multiple generators,
7 Models/scenarios). Two separate upstream issues were found and are now both worked
around by this connector's pins; **full translation is confirmed working end-to-end**
against that fixture with them in place.

**1. Horizon-resolution bug in `r2x_plexos` — fixed upstream in 0.3.0, not yet in this
connector's original pin.** `r2x_plexos` resolves a PLEXOS model's simulation horizon
by reading its `Horizon` object's "Chrono Date From"/"Chrono Date To" attributes
(`r2x_plexos.utils_plexosdb.resolve_horizon_for_model`). `r2x_plexos==0.2.0` (what the
`r2x` meta-package still transitively pins as of this writing) only catches
`AssertionError` when they're unset; `plexosdb` instead raises
`plexosdb.exceptions.NotFoundError` when the attribute isn't registered for the class
at all — not a subclass of `AssertionError` — so the exception propagated uncaught on
**every** Model in the test fixture (none of its 7 Models set explicit Chrono dates,
the common case for studies that don't use PLEXOS's chronological/rolling-horizon
feature). Confirmed fixed in `r2x_plexos>=0.3.0` by inspecting the released wheel
directly (`except (AssertionError, _NotFoundError):`). Filed upstream so `r2x` itself
picks it up: [NatLabRockies/R2X#299](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/R2X/issues/299).
This connector now pins `r2x-plexos>=0.3.0` directly rather than the `r2x`
meta-package, specifically to get this fix.

**2. `r2x_plexos>=0.3.0` requires `plexosdb>=1.6.0`, whose `plexos2duckdb>=0.1.0b11`
dependency has no non-yanked stable release.** `plexos2duckdb`'s only stable release,
`0.1.0`, is yanked from PyPI ("doesn't contain any binaries and should not be used"),
leaving no non-prerelease version satisfying `plexosdb`'s requirement. Filed upstream:
[epri-dev/plexos2duckdb#3](https://github.com/epri-dev/plexos2duckdb/issues/3).
Worked around here with `--prerelease=allow` (see Install, above) until a new stable
`plexos2duckdb` release ships.

**Verified fix, against the same fixture and exact code path this connector uses**:

```bash
uv pip install --prerelease=allow "r2x-plexos>=0.3.0" "r2x-plexos-to-sienna>=0.1.0" "r2x-sienna>=0.4.0"
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/NatLabRockies/plexosdb.git
python -c "

from r2x_plexos import PLEXOSConfig, PLEXOSParser

```

## What's out of scope here

- Forking or vendoring `plexosdb`, `plexosdb-mcp`, or `r2x`.
- Requiring a PLEXOS license, install, or vendor network call anywhere in this
  connector.
- Publishing `plexosdb-mcp` to PyPI ourselves — that's upstream's call.
- Solving translated Sienna systems — that's the sibling `SIENNA` connector
  (PowerMCP #54), which also owns `translate_to_plexos`.
