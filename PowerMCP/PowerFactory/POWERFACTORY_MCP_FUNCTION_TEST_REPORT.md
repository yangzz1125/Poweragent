> **Historical scope:** The document-control metadata and live FT results describe the original 1 September 2026 verification. Section 5 and UT-01 were refreshed on 19 September 2026 against PR #77 commit `2aeb38b`; that refresh used mocked PowerFactory objects and did not re-run the live FT scenarios.

Related implementation report: [PowerMCP PowerFactory Tooling Contribution Report](POWERFACTORY_MCP_CONTRIBUTION_REPORT.md)

## 1. Test objective

The objective was to verify that all eight locally contributed MCP tools behave correctly against a live PowerFactory project and that the model remains calculation-ready after temporary modifications and cleanup. The extended verification also covered single-line diagram synchronization and automatic circuit-breaker creation inside generated cubicles.

The contributed tools under test were:

1. `get_active_project`
2. `get_active_study_case`
3. `get_parameters`
4. `list_objects`
5. `list_components`
6. `list_study_cases`
7. `add_component`
8. `delete_component`

Existing PowerMCP tools-`ping`, `create_study_case`, `run_loadflow`, and `run_short_circuit`-were used as supporting verification operations. They are not claimed as contributions in this report.

## 2. Test strategy

Verification combined three evidence levels:

1. **Compilation:** Python syntax validation for implementation and test files.
2. **Automated unit tests:** Positive, validation, failure, and rollback paths using controlled fake PowerFactory objects.
3. **Live PowerFactory tests:** AI-driven MCP calls against the `test` project, including object discovery, parameter inspection, in-service equipment creation, graphical insertion and deletion, circuit-breaker inspection, load flow, short circuit, guarded deletion, absence checks, and post-cleanup calculations.

### Acceptance criteria

A test was considered successful when:

- The MCP response contained `success=true` where applicable.
- Returned project, study-case, object, and attribute data matched the live PowerFactory model.
- Created equipment retained its requested class, attributes, type, terminal connections, and service state.
- Load-flow and short-circuit calculations completed successfully with temporary equipment in service.
- Confirmed deletion removed the target and its associated cubicles.
- `update_graphics=true` inserted and removed the corresponding single-line diagram object.
- Every generated connection cubicle contained one closed circuit breaker (`StaSwitch`, `aUsage="cbk"`, `on_off=1`).
- Deleting a connected component removed its generated cubicle and circuit breaker.
- Exact-name absence checks returned `total_count=0` after deletion.
- Load flow and short circuit still completed after cleanup.
- Automated tests ended with `OK`, regardless of expected negative-path log messages.

## 3. Overall result

| Test ID | Area | Result |
|---|---|---|
| UT-01 | Compilation and automated tests | PASS |
| FT-01 | Active project and study-case inspection | PASS |
| FT-02 | Multi-parameter reading | PASS |
| FT-03 | Raw object and friendly component discovery | PASS |
| FT-04 | Study-case discovery | PASS |
| FT-05 | Bus, line, and load creation | PASS |
| FT-06 | In-service generator creation and calculations | PASS |
| FT-07 | In-service transformer creation and calculations | PASS |
| FT-08 | Guarded deletion for all supported types | PASS |
| FT-09 | Absence checks and post-cleanup calculations | PASS |
| FT-10 | Single-line diagram insertion, deletion, and refresh | PASS WITH DOCUMENTED LIMITATION |
| FT-11 | Automatic circuit-breaker creation and cleanup | PASS |

**Overall outcome: PASS**

All eight contributed functions and the two extended component-management behaviors were verified. No temporary test component or generated test switchgear remained in the PowerFactory model at the end of testing.

## 5. Automated test results

### Refreshed test run

The automated evidence was refreshed on 19 September 2026 against PR #77 commit `2aeb38b` using Windows 11 AMD64, Python 3.12.14, and pytest 9.1.1. The four tested files were verified byte-for-byte against that commit before execution.

Commands were run from the repository root:

```powershell
& $Python -m py_compile `
    .\PowerFactory\Agent_DIgSILENT.py `
    .\PowerFactory\MCP_PowerFactory.py `
    .\PowerFactory\test_component_creation.py `
    .\PowerFactory\test_state_inspection.py

& $Python -m pytest `
    .\PowerFactory\test_component_creation.py `
    .\PowerFactory\test_state_inspection.py `
    -v --tb=short --color=no -p no:cacheprovider
```

### Result

```text
29 passed, 3 subtests passed in 0.87s
```

### Automated test coverage

The 29 tests cover component creation and rollback, input edge cases, case-insensitive exact-name lookup over case-sensitive PowerFactory queries, guarded deletion, cubicle protection and cleanup, graphical-update behavior, structured result serialization, cold-start reads, and state/discovery operations. Three capitalization variants are recorded as subtests.

These tests use fake/mock PowerFactory objects; they do not replace the separate live PowerFactory FT evidence. The complete command, environment, test names, and captured output are preserved in UT-01.

## 9. Live test FT-04 - Study-case discovery

### Objective

Verify that `list_study_cases` returns available study cases and marks the active one.

### Input

```text
list_study_cases(max_results=20)
```

### Observed result

- Total study cases: 7
- Returned study cases: 7
- `Case 1` marked `is_active=true`

  ]
}
```

**Status: PASS**

### Conclusion

`list_study_cases` returned all seven available study cases and correctly identified `Case 1` as active.

**Supporting evidence:** [FT-04 study-case discovery](evidence/FT-04_study_case_discovery.txt)

## 10. Live test FT-05 - Bus, line, and load creation

### Objective

Verify that `add_component` creates and connects an in-service bus, line, and load that can participate in a converged load flow.

### Test objects

| Type | Temporary name | Principal input |
|---|---|---|
| Bus | `Unified AI Bus 20260820C` | `nominal_voltage_kv=345.0` |
| Line | `Unified AI Line 20260820C` | Bus 01 to new bus, template `Line 01 - 02.ElmLne`, 1.0 km |
| Load | `Unified AI Load 20260820C` | New bus, 1.0 MW, 0.25 Mvar |

All three objects used:

```text
grid_name="Grid"
out_of_service=false
open_digsilent=true
```

### Observed creation results

## 13. Live test FT-08 - Guarded deletion

### Objective

Verify preview behavior, exact confirmation, connection cleanup, and deletion for every component type supported by `delete_component`.

### Input

Each supported component type-`bus`, `load`, `generator`, `line`, and `transformer`-was submitted first without confirmation to obtain a preview, then with the exact confirmation string:

```text
DELETE <component_type> <component_name>
```

All calls used `grid_name="Grid"` and `open_digsilent=true`.

### Supported types exercised

| Type | Live deletion evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Bus | Deleted after its load and line were removed | PASS |
| Load | Previewed, rejected incorrect confirmation, deleted, recreated, and deleted again | PASS |
| Generator | Confirmed deletion of `MCP Verification Generator 20260822A` | PASS |
| Line | Previewed, deleted, recreated, and deleted again | PASS |
| Transformer | Confirmed deletion of `MCP Verification Transformer 20260822A` | PASS |

### Exact confirmation examples

```text
DELETE load Unified AI Load 20260820C
DELETE line Unified AI Line 20260820C
DELETE bus Unified AI Bus 20260820C
DELETE generator MCP Verification Generator 20260822A
DELETE transformer MCP Verification Transformer 20260822A
```

### Representative confirmed responses

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "deleted": true,
  "message": "Deleted generator: MCP Verification Generator 20260822A"
}
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "deleted": true,
  "message": "Deleted transformer: MCP Verification Transformer 20260822A"
}
```

### Guard behavior verified

- Missing confirmation produced preview-only output.
- Incorrect confirmation returned `success=false` and did not delete the object.
- A connected bus could not be deleted until connected equipment was removed.
- Associated cubicles were removed with connected equipment.
- Exact-name re-creation succeeded after deletion, demonstrating cleanup.

**Status: PASS**

### Conclusion

`delete_component` enforced its preview and exact-confirmation safeguards and removed every supported component type together with tested connection cubicles.

## 14. Live test FT-09 - Absence and post-cleanup calculations

### Objective

Confirm that temporary equipment and connections were removed and that the original model remained calculation-ready.

### Absence checks

```text
list_objects(
    object_query="MCP Verification Transformer 20260822A.ElmTr2",
    max_results=5
)
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total_count": 0,
  "returned_count": 0,
  "results": []
}
```

```text
list_objects(
    object_query="MCP Verification Generator 20260822A.ElmSym",
    max_results=5
)
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total_count": 0,
  "returned_count": 0,
  "results": []
}
```

### Final calculation results

```json
{"success": true, "message": "Load flow OK"}
```

```json
{"success": true, "message": "Short-circuit calculation OK"}
```

### Conclusion

Both temporary in-service components were absent, and the cleaned model successfully completed load flow and short circuit.

**Status: PASS**

## 15. Live test FT-10 - Single-line diagram synchronization

### Objective

Verify that `update_graphics=true` inserts a newly created component into the active single-line diagram and removes its graphical object during confirmed deletion.

### Input and observed result

An out-of-service load named `Graphical Delete Fix Load 20260901B` was created on Bus 01 with graphical updates enabled. The creation response ended with:

```text
out_of_service=True | graphics=updated
```

The load was visible in the active diagram. Deletion was then previewed and confirmed using the exact token:

```text
DELETE load Graphical Delete Fix Load 20260901B
```

The confirmed response reported:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "deleted": true,
  "message": "Deleted load: Graphical Delete Fix Load 20260901B | graphics_deleted=1"
}
```

During development, PowerFactory initially retained a stale rendered symbol even though the underlying graphical object had been deleted. Adding an application `Rebuild()` after verified graphical-object deletion resolved the display refresh. The final automated response reported `graphics_refresh=rebuilt`, and live visual inspection confirmed that the symbol disappeared.

The expanded `20260901F` test exercised all five supported component types. A
standalone bus inserted directly with graphical updates was positioned far from
the existing network, causing PowerFactory to zoom out. Recreating that bus
without graphics and then inserting its connecting line with graphical updates
caused PowerFactory to insert the missing bus and line together near Bus 01.
The load, generator, and transformer were subsequently visible in the active
diagram. Confirmed cleanup of the five objects reported
`graphics_deleted=1 | graphics_refresh=rebuilt` for every supported type.

### Conclusion

Graphical insertion and confirmed graphical deletion both worked when explicitly requested. The active single-line diagram was rebuilt after deletion to clear stale rendering. Direct insertion of an isolated bus remains functional but may produce an undesirable automatic position; inserting the bus together with its first connecting line produced the preferred layout.

**Status: PASS WITH DOCUMENTED LIMITATION**

## 16. Live test FT-11 - Circuit-breaker creation and cleanup

### Objective

Verify that a connected component receives one closed circuit breaker in its generated cubicle and that deletion removes the associated cubicle and switch.

### Test object

```text
Component: Circuit Breaker Test Load 20260901B.ElmLod
Bus: Bus 01
Active power: 1.0 MW
Reactive power: 0.25 Mvar
Component state: out of service
Graphical update: requested
```

### Retained connection evidence

`get_parameters` returned one load with `outserv=1` and `bus1` referencing its generated cubicle:

```text
Bus 01.ElmTerm\Circuit Breaker Test Load 20260901B Cubi.StaCubic
```

The matching child switch was then inspected:

```json
{
  "name": "Switch",
  "class_name": "StaSwitch",
  "full_name": "...Circuit Breaker Test Load 20260901B Cubi.StaCubic\\Switch.StaSwitch",
  "values": {
    "aUsage": "cbk",
    "on_off": 1
  }
}
```

This verifies that the generated cubicle contained one circuit breaker and that the breaker was closed. The load itself remained out of service, demonstrating that component service state and breaker state are controlled independently.

### Cleanup evidence

The confirmed deletion removed the load and its cubicle hierarchy. The global `StaSwitch` count returned from 122 to the pre-test baseline of 121, the exact load query returned `total_count=0`, and the post-cleanup load flow returned `Load flow OK`.

Expanded multi-type verification created an in-service bus, line, load,
generator, and transformer. The project-wide switch count rose from 121 to
127. Exactly six matching switches were present: two for the line, one for the
load, one for the generator, and two for the transformer. Every matching
switch returned `aUsage="cbk"` and `on_off=1`.

After dependency-safe confirmed deletion, all five exact object queries
returned `total_count=0`, no matching test switch remained, and the global
switch count returned to 121. Load flow and short-circuit calculation both
succeeded after cleanup.

### Conclusion

Automatic circuit-breaker creation, retained breaker attributes, component-state independence, and hierarchical cleanup were all verified against the live PowerFactory model.

**Status: PASS**

## 17. Deviations and observations

1. The VS Code AI client initially required deferred tool discovery before all read-only tools became visible. Once resolved, every requested tool executed successfully.
2. FastMCP responses wrap the tool's JSON string in an outer `result` field. This report presents decoded inner JSON for readability while preserving the original meaning.
3. PowerFactory object references such as `bus1`, `bushv`, `buslv`, and `typ_id` are represented as strings because they are not native JSON scalar values.
4. Graphical synchronization is opt-in through `update_graphics=true`; the default remains `false` to avoid unsolicited diagram changes.
5. Confirmed deletion remains destructive despite preview and confirmation safeguards.
6. The tests verify supported classes only: `ElmTerm`, `ElmLod`, `ElmSym`, `ElmLne`, and `ElmTr2`.
7. Relay, CT, and VT creation is outside the present scope. The generated cubicles currently contain a circuit breaker only.
8. Direct graphical insertion of an isolated bus can place it far from the existing network and expand the fitted viewport. Creating the bus without graphics and inserting it with its first connecting line produced a better anchored layout.

## 18. Final conclusion

All eight contributed PowerFactory MCP functions passed automated and live verification.

The read-only tools correctly reported the active context, object identities, parameters, friendly component categories, and study cases. `add_component` created all five supported equipment types with verified attributes, types, service states, cubicles, circuit breakers, terminal assignments, and optional graphical insertion. The network completed load-flow and short-circuit calculations with temporary generator and transformer equipment in service. `delete_component` enforced preview and exact confirmation behavior, removed supported equipment, generated connections, circuit breakers, and requested graphical objects, and left no tested residual objects. Final calculations succeeded after cleanup.

Within the documented scope and limitations, the contributed tools are verified for controlled local PowerMCP use.
