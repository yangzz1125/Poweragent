# DIgSILENT PowerFactory MCP Agent

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes DIgSILENT PowerFactory simulation capabilities to AI assistants such as Claude. The agent automates RMS transient stability simulations, load flow and short-circuit calculations, parameter modifications, and result exports — all through a clean, tool-callable interface.

## Features

- **Full simulation pipeline** — connect, activate study case, load flow, RMS transient simulation, CSV export, plot generation, optional PFD export in one call.
- **Custom fault scenarios** — define bus faults, line faults, and generator switching events at call time without editing config files.
- **Parameter modification** — update any PowerFactory attribute on any object via the MCP interface.
- **Model inspection and discovery** — inspect the active project and study case, read selected attributes, and discover objects using raw queries or friendly component categories.
- **Guarded component management** — create or safely preview and delete buses, loads, generators, lines, and two-winding transformers.
- **Diagram and switchgear synchronization** — optionally update the active single-line diagram and create one closed circuit breaker in each generated connection cubicle.
- **Load flow and short-circuit** — run Load flow and Short-Circuit calculation.
- **Automatic plot generation** — bus voltage magnitudes and generator speeds plotted from exported CSV results.
- **Study case management** — create, copy, and activate study cases with idempotency support (replay-safe via `request_id`).
- **Project import/export** — import `.pfd` files and export the active project back to `.pfd`.
- **CSV result reading** — auto-discovers the latest result file or reads a specified path.
- **JSON configuration** — all simulation parameters controlled through `simulation_config.json`.

## Component Management

### Create a component

```text
add_component(
    component_type,
    component_name,
    parameters,
    grid_name="",
    out_of_service=false,
    open_digsilent=true,
    update_graphics=false
)
```

Supported component parameters:

| Type | Required parameters | Optional parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `bus` | `nominal_voltage_kv` | — |
| `load` | `bus_name`, `active_power_mw` | `reactive_power_mvar` |
| `generator` | `bus_name`, `template_generator`, `active_power_mw` | `reactive_power_mvar` |
| `line` | `bus1_name`, `bus2_name`, `template_line`, `length_km` | — |
| `transformer` | `high_voltage_bus_name`, `low_voltage_bus_name`, `template_transformer` | — |

Component names are limited to 40 characters, matching PowerFactory's
`loc_name` limit.

An explicit `null` for optional reactive power is treated as an omitted value
and defaults to zero. Boolean values are not accepted for numeric parameters.

Each generated connection cubicle contains one closed circuit breaker
(`StaSwitch`, `aUsage="cbk"`, `on_off=1`). Set `update_graphics=true` to
request insertion into the active single-line diagram.

Graphical updates use the Diagram Layout Tool's automatic insertion mode so
existing diagram objects are not re-laid out as a K-neighbourhood.

If graphical insertion fails, the network component remains created and the
tool returns `success=false` with the graphical error. Check the returned
message before retrying to avoid creating a duplicate.

PowerFactory may place an isolated bus far from the existing network when it
is inserted directly into the diagram. For a better anchored result, create
the bus with `update_graphics=false`, then create its first connecting line
with `update_graphics=true`.

### Delete a component

```text
delete_component(
    component_type,
    component_name,
    grid_name="",
    confirmation="",
    open_digsilent=true,
    update_graphics=false
)
```

Calling `delete_component` without confirmation returns a preview and the
required confirmation phrase:

```text
DELETE <component_type> <full PowerFactory object path>
```

Name lookup is case-insensitive. The confirmation phrase contains the full
PowerFactory object path, binds the confirmation to the previewed grid, and
must be copied exactly from the preview.

Confirmed deletion removes the exact component. A connection cubicle is removed
only when its generated name and sole generated circuit breaker both match;
cubicles containing relays, instrument transformers, or other objects are
preserved. A bus cannot be deleted while it still has connected cubicles. Set
`update_graphics=true` to remove matching diagram objects from every single-line
diagram in the active project and rebuild the active view.

The response reports component deletion separately from cleanup. In particular,
`success=false` with `deleted=true` means the network component was removed but
some graphical or cubicle cleanup failed; do not retry the component deletion.

## Prompt Examples

Below are example prompts you can send to an AI assistant connected to this MCP server.

```
Ping the PowerFactory server and confirm it's reachable.
```

**Run a load flow**
```
Run a load flow on the active study case and tell me if it converged.
```

**Run a transient fault simulation**
```
Simulate a three-phase bus fault on Bus 25 starting at t=1.0 s, cleared at t=1.08 s,
with a total simulation window of 10 s and a time step of 0.01 s. Export the results
and generate the voltage and generator speed plots.
```

**Modify a parameter before running**
```
Set the generator G 01.ElmSym out of service (e:outserv = 1),

```

**Inspect the active context**
```
Return the active PowerFactory project and study case, then list the first ten
buses without modifying anything.
```

**Create and connect a bus**
```
Create an in-service 110 kV bus named "MCP Example Bus" in Grid without a
graphical update. Connect Bus 01 to it with a 1 km line based on
"Line 01 - 02.ElmLne", request a graphical update for the line, and run a load
flow. Stop if any operation fails.
```

**Preview and delete a component**
```

confirmation phrase and do not perform the confirmed deletion yet.
```

**Create a new study case and run a custom fault**

Create a study case called "Scenario_A" based on "0. Base",
then run a line fault on "Line 12-34.ElmLne" from t=0.5 s to t=0.58 s
in a 15 s window. Save the CSV and plots to C:\Results\Scenario_A.
```

**Short-circuit calculation**
```
Run a short-circuit calculation on the active study case and return the results.
```

**Read the latest results**
```
Read the most recent RMS results CSV and summarise the peak voltage deviations
and minimum generator speed recorded during the simulation.
```

**Import a project and run the full pipeline**
```
Import the project at C:\Projects\IEEE39.pfd, activate it,
then run the full simulation pipeline defined in the config file.
```
