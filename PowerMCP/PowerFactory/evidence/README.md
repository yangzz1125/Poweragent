# PowerFactory MCP supporting evidence

These files support `POWERFACTORY_MCP_FUNCTION_TEST_REPORT.md`.

- **Verbatim transcript:** copied from a complete captured MCP client transcript supplied during verification.
- **Verbatim extract:** an unchanged operation-and-response excerpt from a complete captured transcript.
- **Compiled evidence record:** assembled from raw responses supplied individually during verification; it is evidence, but not represented as a continuous terminal capture.
- **Captured automated transcript:** standard output from an actual automated run; only absolute machine-local executable and repository paths are replaced with documented placeholders.

PowerFactory account identifiers are replaced with `<user>` in committed records.
