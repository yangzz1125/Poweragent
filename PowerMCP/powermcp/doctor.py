"""`powermcp doctor`: check each tool's dependencies and configured paths.

Dependency checks use ``importlib.util.find_spec`` (which locates a module
without executing it) so the doctor never triggers a vendor engine's import-time
side effects (e.g. PSS/E ``psseinit``) and never crashes on a broken DLL. Vendor
engines that load from a captured directory (PSS/E, PSLF, PowerFactory) are not
import-probed at all; they are reported via their configured paths and verified
for real only at runtime.

Two checks are shared rather than per tool and print below the table: the MCP
SDK, which every server imports, and the configured roots used by servers that
call the shared filesystem policy. Both matter here because a server that fails
at launch gives its MCP client nothing at all, and the diagnosis only exists
in a stderr the client does not read, so the doctor has to catch it beforehand.
