name: der-hosting-capacity-mitigation
description: Senior power-engineer playbook for distribution DER integration limits. Use whenever rooftop or utility-scale PV, storage, or other DERs push a feeder into voltage rise, reverse power flow, thermal limits, or protection desensitization — or when the question is how much more DER a feeder can host. Triggers on "hosting capacity", "PV on this feeder", "voltage rise from solar", "reverse power flow", or "DER interconnection on distribution". Pairs naturally with OpenDSS and pandapower feeder studies.

# DER hosting capacity mitigation

Start by identifying the binding constraint, not by assuming it: hosting capacity is set by whichever of voltage, thermal, or protection binds first on this feeder.

## Preferred action order
1. Confirm the binding constraint with feeder snapshots at minimum load / maximum generation (OpenDSS, pandapower): voltage rise along the feeder, reverse flow at the substation, element loading, and regulator behavior.
2. Use inverter capability first: Volt-VAR and Volt-Watt curves, fixed power-factor settings, or export limits — these are cheap, fast, and usually recover significant headroom.
3. Adjust feeder controls next: regulator and LTC setpoints (including reverse-power mode behavior), capacitor switching coordination with the new flow patterns.
4. Re-check protection: reduced relay reach from DER infeed, sympathetic tripping, fuse-recloser coordination, and anti-islanding behavior under high DER output.
5. Reinforce last: reconductoring, an added regulator, phase rebalancing, or load/DER transfers — and quantify the hosting-capacity gain per upgrade so the cheapest sufficient fix wins.

## Working rules
- Study the minimum-load, maximum-generation snapshot; peak-load studies systematically miss DER constraints.
- Voltage rise and protection usually bind before thermal on weak feeders — do not stop at a loading check.
- Validate any fix across the daily profile (or a time-series run), not a single snapshot; Volt-VAR that fixes noon can misbehave at dusk.
- Legacy regulators may misoperate under reverse flow; check their mode explicitly before relying on them.
- Route persistent voltage problems to `voltage-violation-mitigation` and persistent loading problems to `thermal-overload-mitigation` once the DER-specific levers are exhausted.

## Deliver
- The binding constraint (voltage, thermal, protection) with the numbers and the snapshot that exposed it.
- The mitigation sequence applied, from inverter settings to reinforcement.
- The resulting hosting capacity and the first upgrade that buys the next increment.
