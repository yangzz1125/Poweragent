description: Progressive-disclosure workflow for OpenDSS distribution-feeder studies. Use whenever the user wants to compile a DSS model, solve a distribution circuit, inspect feeder bus voltages or power, sweep load multipliers, or run daily / harmonic studies through PowerMCP — even when they just say "solve this feeder", "check the voltages", or "run a daily profile". Exposes a solved base feeder before advanced scenarios. Reach for this instead of answering OpenDSS feeder questions unaided.

# OpenDSS workflow

Start with a solved feeder. Do not jump to daily or harmonic studies until the base feeder compiles and the voltage profile is understood.

## Default tool ladder
1. `compile_and_solve(dss_file)` to load and solve the circuit.
2. `get_total_power()` and `get_bus_voltages()` to confirm the base operating point.
3. `set_load_multiplier(load_mult)` for simple scenario sweeps.
4. `run_daily_energy_meter(meter_name, hours)` for daily feeder behavior.
5. `get_harmonic_results(load_name, harmonic)` only after the harmonic question is well scoped.

## Working rules
- Fix compile or solve errors before any scenario analysis.
- For voltage issues, inspect the weak buses first.
- Separate load-growth screening from harmonic analysis; they answer different questions.
- Keep feeder, meter, and load names explicit in the response.

## Escalation triggers
Quote the weak bus + voltage or the loaded element rather than saying "there is a problem".

| Observation | Escalate to |
|---|---|
| `get_bus_voltages` shows pu outside the feeder band (e.g. < 0.95 or > 1.05) | `voltage-violation-mitigation` |
| A line, transformer, or regulator loaded above its rating | `thermal-overload-mitigation` |
| `compile_and_solve` succeeds to compile but the solution diverges | `convergence-failure-mitigation` |
| The study is DER (PV, storage) integration or hosting capacity on the feeder | `der-hosting-capacity-mitigation` |

## Deliver
- The compiled feeder and base-case status.
- The voltage or power quantities checked.
- Any scenario result and whether mitigation is needed.
