name: potpourri
description: Progressive-disclosure workflow for potpourri (opf-potpourri) AC/DC and multi-period optimal power flow on pandapower distribution networks, including storage and flexible resources. Use whenever the user wants to optimise rather than just simulate a pandapower or SimBench grid — curtail or redispatch PV, minimise voltage deviation, losses, reactive power or grid import, run a DC screening OPF, build a multi-period or 96-step OPF with batteries, study hosting capacity, or diagnose an infeasible OPF — even when they just say "optimise this feeder", "minimise losses", "schedule the batteries", or "why is my OPF infeasible". Reach for this instead of answering potpourri or Pyomo OPF questions unaided. For a plain load flow with no optimisation, use the pandapower skill instead.

# potpourri workflow

potpourri builds Pyomo AC/DC OPF models over pandapower networks. There is no
PowerMCP server for it, so drive it through its Python API using the bundled
scripts. Establish a credible network and base case before optimising, and a
credible single period before a multi-period horizon.

## Default ladder
1. `scripts/inspect_case.py --case <simbench:CODE|path.json>` — load, validate,
   and solve the pandapower base case. Do not skip this: an OPF that fails later
   is usually a data problem, and this is where data problems are cheap to find.
2. `scripts/solve_opf.py --list-solvers` — confirm what is installed. AC needs an
   NLP solver (IPOPT); DC needs an LP/MIP solver (GLPK, CBC, HiGHS).
3. `scripts/solve_opf.py --formulation dc --objective ext_grid_import` — linear
   screening for congestion and active-power headroom.
4. `scripts/solve_opf.py --formulation ac --objective <objective>` — the real
   answer whenever voltage, reactive power, losses, or inverter capability matters.
5. `scripts/solve_opf.py --horizon <N> --battery-penetration <pct> --seed <n>` —
   multi-period, only once a single period is credible.

Both scripts print an engineering summary, take `--json` for a machine-readable
payload, and exit non-zero on genuine failure (1 = solved but not optimal,
2 = bad input, 3 = no compatible solver).

## Working rules
- **Never read `net.res_*` without checking termination.** The model constructor
  runs `pp.runpp`, so `net.res_*` is always populated; when a solve is not
  optimal potpourri skips its result mapping and those tables still hold the
  *base case*. `solve_opf.py` reports no results at all in that situation.
- **Multi-period `solve(to_net=True)` writes nothing.** It only logs that it
  did. Map each step with
  `pyo_to_net_multi_period.pyo_sol_to_net_res(net, model, t)`.
- **DC gives no voltage answer.** After a DC OPF `net.res_bus.vm_pu` is a flat
  1.0 placeholder. DC feasibility never establishes AC feasibility, least of all
  in distribution networks where voltage and reactive power are the binding
  physics.
- **A local NLP optimum is not a global one.** IPOPT on a nonconvex AC OPF gives
  a locally optimal point; say "locally optimal", and never claim global
  optimality without a global solver reporting it.
- **Quote numbers, units, and the limit that was configured** — bus and `vm_pu`,
  element and `loading_percent` against its rating, MW/Mvar/MWh, and the solver's
  own termination condition.
- Match the objective to the question and state its side effects: voltage-
  deviation minimisation puts no value on energy, so where curtailment is free it
  will curtail everything. Check the reported curtailment before accepting a
  dispatch.

## Reference material
Read the file that matches what you are doing; do not load them all.
- `references/API_REFERENCE.md` — verified classes, `add_OPF` options, objectives,
  devices, result extraction, and what is *not* supported.
- `references/FORMULATION_GUIDE.md` — AC vs DC, snapshot vs multi-period,
  LP/NLP/MINLP consequences, and single- vs multi-period model differences.
- `references/SOLVER_GUIDE.md` — solver compatibility, termination
  interpretation, and the ordered infeasibility diagnosis.
- `references/VALIDATION_GUIDE.md` — power balance, constraint checks, binding
  constraints, cross-validation against pandapower, and the reporting checklist.

## Local assets in this skill
- `scripts/inspect_case.py` — load, validate, base power flow.
- `scripts/solve_opf.py` — build, solve, validate, and escalate.
- `scripts/test_scripts.py` — smoke tests; skips cleanly without solvers.
- `requirements.txt` — including the `pandapower<3.5` pin potpourri needs.

## Escalation triggers
Quote the element, value, unit, and configured limit that tripped each row.
`solve_opf.py` emits these in its `escalation` payload.

| Observation | Escalate to |
|---|---|
| Bus `vm_pu` outside the configured `[min_vm_pu, max_vm_pu]` band (AC only) | `voltage-violation-mitigation` |
| `res_line` / `res_trafo` `loading_percent` above its configured `max_loading_percent` | `thermal-overload-mitigation` |
| `termination_condition` is `infeasible` or `unbounded`, or curtailment exceeds 5 % of available renewable energy | `operations-planning-mitigation` |
| Solve ends in any other non-optimal condition (`other`, `maxIterations`, `maxTimeLimit`), or the base `pp.runpp` fails | `convergence-failure-mitigation` |
| Net export through the external grid, or PV-driven voltage rise on a distribution feeder | `der-hosting-capacity-mitigation` |
| A newly added generator, storage unit, or large load causes any of the above | `interconnection-impact-mitigation` |

## Deliver
- Network source and size, study type and formulation, horizon and resolution.
- Objective, what it means in units, and the solver plus its termination condition.
- Power balance, voltage extrema with buses, worst line and transformer loading,
  dispatch by group, curtailment, and storage SOC extrema where relevant.
- Binding constraints, and limitations (local optimum, DC assumptions, storage
  modelling caveats).
- Any justified escalation, with the numbers behind it.
